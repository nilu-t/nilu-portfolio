    <h1>Hello, welcome to my site!</h1>

    <div class="p_div">
        <p>
            I'm Nilushanth Thiruchelvam, a third year computer science student 
            at York University. I'm currently enhancing my web development skills
            using Javascript, HTML and CSS by learning popular Javascript frameworks
            like NodeJS, ReactJS and Angular. Also, I'm further enhancing my web 
            development skills using Python through the Flask framework. In my leisure 
            time I like to play chess <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/nilu06">
            (challenge me to a game of chess on Chess.com ðŸ‘€)</a>, online games, and 
            create both web and mobile apps for fun! My passion for web development and 
            mobile development originate from using logical and creative thinking to be
            able to create unique websites from scratch. This website is created to display
            my skills I acquired from my personal projects and education.
